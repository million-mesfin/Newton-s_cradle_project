# Newton's Cradle Project

This project simulates a Newton's Cradle using OpenGL and GLUT. The simulation includes realistic physics for the motion of the spheres and allows for camera manipulation.

## Introduction

Newton's Cradle is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. This project aims to create a visual and interactive simulation of Newton's Cradle, providing an educational tool for understanding these physical principles.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/million-mesfin/NewtonsCradleProject.git](https://github.com/million-mesfin/Newton-s_cradle_project.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Code::Blocks or your preferred IDE.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).

## Usage

1. Build and run the project using your IDE.
2. Use the arrow keys to rotate the camera view.
3. Observe the motion of the spheres in the Newton's Cradle simulation.
